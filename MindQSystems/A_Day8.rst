**Levels Of Testing**
	- As development happens, testing happens simultaneously.
	- Different levels are:
		1. Unit Testing
		2. Module Testing
		3. Input-domain Testing
		4. System Testing
		5. User Acceptance Testing

**Unit Testing**
	- Type of testing done soon after a unit or a block of code is developed. Every unit is tested with desired input to check if it gives the desired output.
	- Practices: Since it is the early stage, we see program. It belongs to WBT and is done by developers.
	- Types:
		- System Coverage Testing: Each programic statement is to be tested.
		- Program speed Testing: Faster the program; higher the performance(ability to  do things faster).
		- Mutation Testing: Sudden change. There are intentional changes done to a program and tested. Till the program is smart enough to identify the changes the program is tested.

**Module Testing**
	- Combination of 2 or more units is called a module. These usits are thorughly developed and tested. So basically once the number of units are prepared to form a module, it is tested to check the functionality perfection. It belongs to BBT and tested by test engineers.
	- Types:
		- GUI Testing: Look and feel of an application.
		- Functional Testing: This is look and interact of an application.
			- Positive testing: Testing the positive flow with the valid data.
			- Negative testing: Testing the negative functional flow with invalid data.
		- Input-Domain Testing: Condition imposed on the field to accept valid data and cheecking if it works.
		- Data base Testing: Two aspects:
			- DB Integrity testing: Storage operations. To check if the data enforced from outside is getting stored as it is.
			- DB Output operation Testing: If the data retrived from DB is shown as it is stored.
