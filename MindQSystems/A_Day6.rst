**Various Flavors of Testing**
	
	- Conventional Testing
	- Unconventional Testing
	- Process Testing

**CONVENTIONAL TESTING**
	
	- Testing a functionality after writing the code
	- It is done by developers
	- Also called as *Validation*

**UNCONVENTIONAL TESTING**
	
	- This is the testing of the documents that are produced in each level of the SDLC
	- This type of testing is done by QC(Quality Control Engineer)
	- This phase is also called as *Verification*

**PROCESS TESTING**

	- Process to check if the responsibilities are accomplished as per the guidelines in all phases of the SDLC
	- This type of testing is done by QA(Quality Assurance Engineer)
	- This phase is also called as *Validation*

**WHEN DO WE KNOW THAT THE DOCUMENT IS PERFECT?**
	
	- Three C's:
		- Information in the document must be Correct, Complete, and Consistent.
		- Consistent: Must be understandable globally. QC takes care of these three C's

**HOW IS PROCESS ACHIEVED**
	
	- If the roles in every SDLC phase are following there guidelines/ objectives are not.
	- QA makes sure this is achieved.
