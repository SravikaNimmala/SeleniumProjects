**QUALITY**
	- (recap): Quality is meeting the customer's requirements. A test engineer must know the requirements and must be met.

**DEVIATION FROM THE QUALITY**
	- There is a possibility that the requirements are not met and a developer and the test engineer may deviate from the benchmark.
	- There are seven different deviations:
		- **Defect**: Deviation from the requirements. Defect is visible and is always associated with the functionality. It is visible to the end user. They are found by test engineers or the customers. This is *effect*.
		- **Error**: We know that the code defines a functionality. It is an invisible mistake in the code. This mistake is associated with the program(code). So basically it is encountered by the developer. This is the *cause*.
		-  **Bug**: Conceptually bug is same the defect. But from the point of usage they are different. Defect is used by both professionals and users/customers. But the word *bug* is exclusively used by professionals. Based on some companies it is different. When a defect is raised it goes back to the developer. And if the defect is accept by the developer then it becomes a bug. So an accepted defect is a bug.
		- **Flaw/Mistake**: Deviation from the right way of doing the task is a mistake. There are two types:	
			- Repairable: Once a mistake is done it can be fixed.
			- Ir-repairable: Once the mistake is done we can only take preventable actions. Damage control.
		- **Issue**: There will be a momentum for every task. Some obstruction has occurred which is unable to overcome. This is called an issue. So an obstruction to a work flow or the task is called issue. There is always a way out of obstruction called as *work around*.
		- **Failure**: State of inability to reach the goal/destiny.
		- **Risk**: It is the negative effect of the task. A potential, possible and adverse effect of a task is called risk.

**QUALITY GAP**
	- The missing of certain quantity of quality is called quality gap.
	- Three scenarios:
		- Defect of task = no satisfaction
		- When requirements are met = satisfaction
		- When final requirements achieved are higher than the customer's requirements = DELIGHT
	- 0% - 100% = Requirement zone.
		- The gap between 0% and 100% is called *requirement gap*.
	- > 100% = Quality zone.
		- The gap between 100% and 200% or in between is called *quality gap*.
	- The gap between a vendor's delivered quality and dream quality is called a *quality gap*.
	- The gap between a customer's desired quality and delivered quality is called a *quality gap*.
	- Two things a test engineer must keep in mind are:
		- DELIGHT > SATISFACTION
		- The current version of a product must always be better than previous version.

**REDEFINED QUALITY**
	- Redefinition of quality is = Presence of requirements + value.
	- Value = User friendly/ Usability
	- A test engineer must aim for *Functional perfection* + *User friendliness* when the final product is delivered.
