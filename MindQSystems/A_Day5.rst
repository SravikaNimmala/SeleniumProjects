**SDLC**
	- Software/System Development Life Cycle
	- 6 phases of SDLC
		1. Initial
		2. Analysis
		3. Design
		4. Code
		5. Testing
		6. Delivery and Maintainance 
	- All these phases come with four different parts
		1. Responsibility
		2. Roles
		3. Process
		4. Outcome

**INITIAL**
	- Responsibility: Gathering requirements for the project.
	- Roles: BA: Business Analyst
			 EM: Engagement Manager
	- Process: A BA must be able to guide both customers and end users.
		- BA: 
			- To gather complete requirements
			- To study existing business model
			- Gap analysis(area where budget, time and effort is misused)
			- Highlight these gaps as new requirement
			- Documentation
		- EM:
			- New requirements to conversions
			- Money related talk
			- Price tag for the new requirement
	- Outcome: Everything is documented in a document called **BDD** [Business design document]. BDD is also called BRD, BRS, FRS. There is template to write this documentation. The document contains high level requirements which come from the customer.

**ANALYSIS**
	- Responsibility: Analysis is done by using BRD as input. We test to check the system requirements.
		- System Requirements: It is the combination of harware and software requirements and functional and non fucntional requirements.
			- Hardware: Computer requirements.
			- Functional: Functionality of an application.
			- Non functional: 
	- Roles: System Analyst(SA)
	- Process:
		- Study the requirements
		- Existing requirements
		- Feasibility study
		- To select the technology
		- To help PM in preparation of project plan
		- Collect all system requirements
		- Will be documented
	- Outcome: SA will keep a System Requirement Specification(SRS) document that documents the process.

**DESIGN**
	- Responsibility: SRS is used as the input. The main responsibility is to create the "blue prrint" for the project development. It is the plan for the construction of the project.
	- Roles:
		- CA: Cheif Architect
		- TL: Technical Lead
	- Process: Design process is implemented in 2 levels.
		1. High Level Design(HLD): Process in which a single project is divided into number of modules(subset).  This is always done by CA.
		2. Low Level Design (LLD): Process in which a module are divided into sub modules. This is always done by TL under QL(Quality Lead).
	- Outcome: Technical Design Document(TDD)
		- The TDD contains the following:
			- High Level Design information
			- Low Level Design information
			- Pictorial representation: A UML is used to design the diagrams.
			- Class Diagram: What classes will be used
			- Object Diagram: Instance of class 

**CODING**
	- Responsibility: To develop the programs/  source code.
	- Roles: Programmer/ Developer.
	- Process:	Consistency 
	- Outcome:

**TESTING**
	- Responsibility:
	- Roles:
	- Process:
	- Outcome:

**DELIVERY AND MAINTAINANCE**
	- Responsibility:
	- Roles
	- Process:
	- Outcome:
