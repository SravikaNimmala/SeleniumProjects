**Why choose the field of testing?**

   - Directly deals with quality.
      - It has to be done.
      - Must requirement to know the stability of the product.
      - Acceptance by the customer.
      - If any defect is detected after the product is released, testing team takes the responsibility. It is a challenging job. It deals directly with quality of the end product.
   - My profile best suits for testing.
      - Nature, attitude and profile of a person can lead them to take an interest in testing.
      - A tester will do this knowingly and in full conscious. 
   - Testing is not associated with boom or hype.
      - Boom: the continuous demand of any product is called boom. But after a certain time there is a possibility for the product to reach its saturation point and hence loose its necessity.
      - Hype: There is a possibility that the information might be exaggerated.
      - Fortunately testing is not associated with boom or hype.
      - **Natural growth** : 10 years ago developers used to write the code as well as test it themselves. There was no dedicated place for testers in the SDLC. There were many defects found after the release. Over a period of time, customer and vendor business was coming down. There was a need for thorough testing. So testing department was established. Because of "NEED" of quality there is a great demand for testing. Testing is naturally growing, hence it is a healthy growth and there is no saturation point for it.
   - How long will it "grow"?
      - As long as there is a need for quality, there is a place for testing tools in the market. Once the customer is used to the quality he wouldn't want a lesser product. Quality is the driving force.
   - Testing is mandatory for the industry.
      - Irrespective of the technology, testing is compulsory.
      - Technologies might change, but testing is mandatory.
   - Testing is independent of technology.
      - When a market is in need of a technology then there is more demand.
      - Market in turn depends of economy. If a global-financial crisis occurs, then the market is destroyed and then there is a fall in the technology demand too.
      - But testing is independent of technology because testing has a constant framework to test the quality of projects written using any technology.
   - Scope for testing:
      - Geological scope: Wherever you go, any corner of the world the need and way of testing doesn't change. 
      - Chronological scope: Timely, it is forever. Natural growth as mentioned above.
      - Professional scope: There is a 100% scope for testers everywhere. There are third party testing companies.
