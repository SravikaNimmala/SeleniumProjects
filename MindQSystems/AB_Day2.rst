**Need for testers to the industry when developers could test**
   - Multiple tasks are assigned to the developers.
      - Developers focus 90% on writing the code and only 10% on testing when assigned two jobs at once.
   - They have a sentimental attachment to the code.
      - Criticism is not readily accepted by the developers and they don't try to test it in depth.

**Testers Qualifications**
   - Quality oriented mind setup
      - Must provide quality at any time.
   - Test to break attitude
      - Breaking attitude to make good.
      - Be open to errors.
   - Internal Customer
      - Act as a customer.
      - Test as a person who uses the final product.
   - Have no idea how program has been developed
      - The developer always tries to convince the tester that the code written is error-free.
      - Taking inputs from a developer can change the mind set of a tester. Hence they should refrain from knowing how the code has been developed.

**Data and Testing**
   - **Data**: Data that makes a functionality run correctly without any errors is called valid data. And the data that is used to test if a functionality projects an err or not is called invalid data.
   - **Testing**: The use of valid data is called positive testing and the use of invalid data is called negative testing.

**Perceptional difference between developer and a test engineer**
   - **Developer**: Has a "to prove" attitude. A developer can end up using valid data to test the code. This process ends up being a *requirement check*.
   - **Tester**: Has a "to break" attitude. A tester uses both valid and invalid data to test the code. Every functionality has a positive and a negative flow like two sides of a coin. It is the responsibility of the test engineer to do both positive and negative testing. Hence testing is robust and is prone to find defects. This process tests the *validation* of the final product.

**Testing**
   - Two types:
      - Manual Testing: Hybrid process and agile process
      - Automation: There are two mostly used software right now in the industry. QTP and Selenium are the two current automation tools in the market that are currently widely used and known. But Selenium is open source and hence might take over everywhere.
         - It is important to learn the formula of Selenium instead of focusing on the constants.

**Manual Testing**
   - When we talk about testing **QUALITY** is the key word. But what is quality? The internal factor of customer is the feeling of satisfaction. When the requirements are met of the customer then the "satisfied" quality is achieved.
