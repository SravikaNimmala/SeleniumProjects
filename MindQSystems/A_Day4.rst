**WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF TESTING**
	- Need to identify defects
	- Documentation of the defects[Defect Profile Document]
	- Subjecting defects for rectification
		- This can be termed as *bug fixation*
		- Developers must verify if the defect is genuine
			- Developers might not accept a defect when proposed, it must be seen multiple times to make sure it is genuine. This process is called "Defect Reproducibility."
		- After the defects/bugs are fixed, they must be re-tested(the cycle repeats).
	- Ensure that the final product is defect free so the quality of the product and the satisfaction of the customer is achieved.

**TESTING**
	- The above process is called testing. 
	- Def: Testing is a process in which defects are identified, documented, subjected for rectification to ensure that the product is defect free; to provide quality to the product and satisfaction to the customer.

**WHERE DOES TESTING COME INTO PICTURE**
	- **SDLC**: Software Development Life Cycle.
	- Software: A collection of programs that are executed sequentially.
	- Project: It is an assigned work that must be accomplished within a defined time.
	- How is the project originated
		- Pre-SDLC / Project Origination / Project Acquisition.
		- To run a business or some type of management system the customer "needs" a software. **Project always comes from the need of customer to provide a solution**.
	- Project & Product: They are differentiated from where the requirements are coming from.
		- **Project**: It is an outcome that is prepared based on the requirements of customer. It is tailor made; meaning it is fit for the needs of a particular customer.
		- **Product**: Someone in the company prepares a solution based on the general requirements. Product can be sold to various customers. They are ready made.
	- Customer has to prepare the needs/requirements and send to various vendors(solution provider). A **RFP** [Request for Proposal] is prepared where the customer receives a project proposal. **RFQ** [Request for Quotation] is also requested by the customer from the vendor to know the budget details.
	- Once the customer chooses the adaptable proposal and quote a **Project Sign In** is prepared. It is an official agreement is made between the customer and the vendor.
	- **SOW** [Statement of Work]: Next a SOW is prepared which ensures and specifies the specific activities for a vendor providing services to the client/customer.
	- Then the representative of the vendor company proposes the project at the kick off meeting. In this kick off meeting, the overview of the project, the overview of the customer, project team members, project leads are selected. The PM-Project manager initiates the project development activities. He need to follow a protocol called **PIN** [Project Initiation Note]. This is sent to the CEO for the official approval to take start/accept the project.
	- Finally the PM initiates the SDLC.
